# DFPlayer_Theater_Soundboard
Arduino and DFPlayer based soundboard optomised for theater

# hardware:
1) arduino pro mini 
2) Genuine DFPlayer mini mp3 module - clones with 'ME-ET LIVE' chips have fewer serial features and often donâ€™t even work with the default serial Arduino example from DFPlayer.  They are fine for prototyping being about 1/5 the cost and ideal for simpler projects not needing Arduino serial communication.
